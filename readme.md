# Simple FtsoRegistry Dapp
This a simple dApp illustrating how to interact with Flare FtsoRegistry Contract.

# IFtsoRegistry.sol
More detailed documentation has been added to the `IFtsoRegistry.sol` and it can be found in [IFtsoRegistry.sol](https://github.com/gconnect/FtsoRegistry-Dapp/blob/master/blockchain/contracts/IFtsoRegistry.sol)

# Frontend Javascript Interraction

## Node Interaction
The JavaScript interactions were done in two ways. The FtsoRegisry was implemented on the `FtsoPriceFeeds.sol` contract. The code that handles interactions can be found in the [contract-interact.ts](https://github.com/gconnect/FtsoRegistry-Dapp/blob/master/blockchain/scripts/contract-interact.ts) and [interact.ts](https://github.com/gconnect/FtsoRegistry-Dapp/blob/master/blockchain/scripts/interact.ts) file.

## Next.js Interaction
The Next.js frontend interaction can be found in [utils/interact.ts]()
